# About this folder
This folder holds things like the python requirements.txt file that applies to all projects across the board.

Python will also be downloaded as a package from a packge store during CMAKE configure, and will be committed to this folder, under a sub-folder called "runtime/(operating system name)" which is why its in the ignore file.
